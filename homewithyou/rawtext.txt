home with you 
by: fka twigs

I'm so wired for it, seen it, tried it 
I'd die for you on my terms 
When I get my lessons learned 



Breathe in, breathe out, pain 
No, no, Novocaine 
Still maintain my grace 



How come the more you have the more that people want from you? 
The more you burn away the more the people earn from you 
The more you pull away the more that they depend on you 
I've never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi <br>

Have you ever seen a hero like you in a sci-fi? 


So I wonder if your needs are even meant for me 
I wonder if you think that I could ever raise you up 
I wonder if you think that I could ever help you fly?



But I've seen my love and I thought it belonged to you 
Mary Magdalene would never let her loved ones down 

Would Mary Magdalene let her loved ones down?


I, didn't know that you were lonely <br>
If you'd have just told me, I'd be home with you 
I, didn't know that you were lonely 
If you'd have just told me I'd be running down the hills to you 

Did you know that you were lonely?


When I visualize 
All I see is black 

Do you see black?


If you'd had just told me I'd be home with you, 

Would you be running down the hills to me? 



And I'd have told you I was lonely too
